# **Message Passing Graph Neural Networks**

An implementation of *Message Passing Graph Neural Networks* in **mlx** as described in arXiv:1704.01212v2.
> Supervised learning on molecules has incredi- ble potential to be useful in chemistry, drug dis- covery, and materials science. Luckily, sev- eral promising and closely related neural network models invariant to molecular symmetries have already been described in the literature. These models learn a message passing algorithm and aggregation procedure to compute a function of their entire input graph. At this point, the next step is to find a particularly effective variant of this general approach and apply it to chemical prediction benchmarks until we either solve them or reach the limits of the approach. In this pa- per, we reformulate existing models into a sin- gle common framework we call Message Pass- ing Neural Networks (MPNNs) and explore ad- ditional novel variations within this framework. Using MPNNs we demonstrate state of the art re- sults on an important molecular property predic- tion benchmark; these results are strong enough that we believe future work should focus on datasets with larger molecules or more accurate ground truth labels.
