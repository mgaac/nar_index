# **Neural Turing Machines**

An implementation of *Neural Turing Machines* in mlx as described by arXiv:1410.5401v2.

> We extend the capabilities of neural networks by coupling them to external memory re-
sources, which they can interact with by attentional processes. The combined system is
analogous to a Turing Machine or Von Neumann architecture but is differentiable end-to-
end, allowing it to be efficiently trained with gradient descent. Preliminary results demon-
strate that Neural Turing Machines can infer simple algorithms such as copying, sorting,
and associative recall from input and output examples.
