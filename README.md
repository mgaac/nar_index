# *nar_index*

A proto-index, perhaps, abiding by today's zeitgeist, a sort of worklog. A response to a now somewhat repulsive feeling towards
anything having to do with LLMs. Implemented in MLX and at times accompanied by commentary, the techniques/methods/papers implemented
were curated by myself and, as such, suffer from the noble curse of at times seeming too scattered. An attempt was made to nonetheless
keep them focused around the area of Neural Algorithmic Reasoning and, in the spririt of Francois Chollet, deep learning guided program
synthesis.
