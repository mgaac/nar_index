# *nar_index*

A proto-index, perhaps, abiding by todayâ€™s zeitgeist, a sort of worklog. A response to a now somewhat repulsive feeling
towards anything having to do with LLMs. Implemented in MLX and at times accompanied by commentary, the techniques/methods/papers
implemented were curated by myself and, as such, suffer from the noble curse of at times seeming too dispersed, too scattered. An attempt
was made to nonetheless keep them focused around the area of Neural Algorithmic Reasoning. In particular, the ideas behind Algorithmic
Alignment and its applications.
